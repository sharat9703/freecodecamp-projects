          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.s</li>
         <li class="mt-4"> He served as the 11th President
          of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
         <li class="mt-4">Kalam earned a degree in
          aeronautical engineering from the
          Madras Institute of Technology and in
          1958 joined the Defence Research and
          Development Organisation (DRDO).

         <li class="mt-4">  In 1969, he moved to the Indian
          Space Research Organization, where he
          was project director of the SLV-III, the
          first satellite launch vehicle that was
          both designed and produced in India.
</li>
         <li class="mt-4"> Among those successes
          was Agni, India's first intermediate-range
          ballistic missile, which incorporated
          aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
          in 1989.</li>
         <li class="mt-4">He also played a

          the original nuclear test by India in 1974. </li>

          the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests
          solidified India as a nuclear power and
          established Kalam as a national hero,
          although the tests caused great concern
          in the international community.</li>
         <li class="mt-4">In 1998 Kalam put
          forward a countrywide plan called
          Technology Vision 2020, which he described
          as a road map for transforming India from
          a less-developed to a developed society
          in 20 years. The plan called for, among
          other measures, increasing agricultural
          productivity, emphasizing technology as
          a vehicle for economic growth, and
          widening access to health care and
          education.

          DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
          to the Government.</li>
         <li class="mt-4"> In 1997, Kalam received
          India's highest civilian honour, the
          Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
          the scientific research and modernisation
          of defence technology in India.</li>
         <li class="mt-4">In 2013, he was the
          recipient of the Von Braun Award from
          the National Space Society "to recognize
          excellence in the management and leadership
          of a space-related project".</li>
         <li class="mt-4">While delivering a
          lecture at the Indian Institute of
          Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
          died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
          <strong>27 July 2015</strong>, aged 83.</li>
